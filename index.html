                  If somebody told me a week ago that I will become
                  web developer, I would say to them no way I guess.

                <p>
                  But seems like I am on my way of becoming one of you guys
                  with a help of that great app that I am using on my mobile phone
                  called Mimo...
                  And I can hardly wait to learn how to make web site animated using Javascript,
                  and dynamic using PHP I hope.
